      <p>I'm sure you know from theory and experience that there are about a million (if not more!) reasons not to serve
        God in the Church or be passionate about ministry.</p>
      <p>Well, here you will find 2 more such reasons. So for those of you who are like me--trying to find reasons not
        to do certain things!--this, I hope, will prove itself to be extremely helpful!</p>
      <p>Before we jump into these self-justifying tips you're probably already excited about, let's look at what God
        thinks about ministry. There was a man named Jesus, who was sent by God the Father to die for the sin of
        humanity and then be raised up from the dead to justify those who would repent of their sin and trust in him as
        their Savior. During his life on Earth, this Jesus revealed in words and action what it is to serve God and
        others. And to his listeners he conveyed in many different ways the importance of ministry. One of these methods
        were parables.</p>
      <p>(A parable is a short, fictitious but realistic story with a particular moral attached to it.)</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, Jesus frequently compared good ministry to a servant-and-lord scenario. He described the
        servant as good, faithful, and wise. By painting these episodes, Jesus called for self-denying, others-serving,
        love-saturated, and God-honoring ministry. But who likes that?! So here you go! Two reasons to not serve God
        with all your heart.</p>

      <h1>Reason #1: Jesus is not coming at all, or at least, not that soon!</h1>

      <p>In one of his parables (recorded in the Bible, Matthew 24:45-51), Jesus told the story of a lord who assigned
        one of his servants the task of handing out food at the proper time until he returns. When the master had
        departed, the servant said, "My lord won't come that soon!" He then began to abuse his fellow servants and spent
        his time partying with drunkards.</p>
      <p>There are always those who mock Jesus' second coming. Their argument is that "all continues just as it was from
        the beginning of creation" (2Pet. 3:4, NASB, Holy Bible). We've heard so much about Jesus coming soon, it
        doesn't seem he's going to come at all. Perhaps he's forgotten for a while about his promise.</p>
      <p>Had the servant taken his master's command seriously, he would have been described as faithful, sensible, and
        blessed. The master would have placed him in charge of everything else he had, says Jesus.</p>
      <p>But "the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not
        know, and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping
        and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 24:50-51, NASB, Holy Bible). How unfortunate of an ending is that!</p>

      <h1>Reason #2: Jesus is coming too soon.</h1>

      <p>In another parable (recorded also in the Bible, Matthew 25:14-30), Jesus told the story of a lord who entrusted
        his possessions to three of his servants to make profit until he came back. Upon return of their lord, the first
        two gave account of their labors, after what each heard the master say, "Well done, good and faithful slave. You
        were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master"
        (Matt. 25:21, NASB, Holy Bible).</p>
      <p>The third servant brought nothing new to his lord, save a long speech he must have prepared and refined the
        entire time of the master's absence. In his monologue, he mentioned this, "I was afraid, and went away and hid
        your talent in the ground" (Matt. 25:25, NASB, Holy Bible).</p>
      <p>As Christians put on Earth for the purpose of spreading God's glory, we sometimes get distracted by all the
        demoralizing stuff happening around: natural disasters, wars and terrorism, health issues, financial hardships,
        marriage problems, spreading immorality, etc. Sometimes all we want to do is go and hide somewhere, far away
        from all these challenges, or feel that time is so short there is no point in even trying to do anything.</p>
      <p>God calls such servants evil and lazy, "Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place
        there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 25:30, NASB, Holy Bible).</p>
      <p>There you have it. Just in case you were looking for a few viable excuses when it comes to serving God!</p>
      <p>Now, good luck.</p>
