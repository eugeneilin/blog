      <p>They are the most recognizable four notes in all of music.</p>

      <p>But what do they mean?</p>

      <p>“Fate knocking at the door,” some, familiar with the legend of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, will answer. And,
        yes, that notion captures the awesome effect of that notorious motif quite precisely. But those four notes, so
        pregnant with significance, herald something even mightier. In 1803, Beethoven declared, “I am not satisfied
        with what I have composed up to now. From now on I intend to embark on a new path.” Four years later, the new
        direction of Beethoven’s artistic pursuits would be made manifest in resounding fashion in the sea-parting
        Fifth.</p>

      <p>It must be stated at the outset that that consequential motif—Da-da-da-daaaa…—is not much of a melody. And,
        realizing this, one might consider the question, Well, then, what does make Beethoven so great? If not his
        melodies, perhaps his harmonies. (But think of the harmonic simplicity of the “Ode to Joy.”) Not his harmonies,
        then, but, presaging the likes of Stravinsky and Messiaen, it must be his rhythmic creativity. (But, the
        Allegretto of the Seventh Symphony.) Nothing groundbreaking in Beethoven’s approach to rhythm. What, then? His
        counterpoint? orchestration?</p>

      <p>No, what makes Beethoven Beethoven has not to do with the musical idea itself, but with what he does with the
        musical idea. Hear, in the Fifth, the immensity of that four-note motif: never had such a compact gesture been
        deployed to such thrilling effect. It serves as the foundational building block of the tautly dramatic Allegro
        con brio—a movement of remarkably limited harmonic range. From C minor—the Symphony’s home key, and more
        broadly, the customary key of Beethoven’s darkest moods—the work proceeds to E-flat major for the lyrical second
        theme (still underpinned by those incessant four notes); the subsequent development section oscillates between C
        minor and F minor, with only a brief moment in G major, and otherwise hardly any major chords at all. This
        spartan harmonic setting serves only to sharpen the pointed intensity of the movement’s germinal four-note
        motif. “The dominating motto and the rhythmic and harmonic compression create the force behind the first
        movement,” writes Lewis Lockwood, “which unleashes a tragic power in the symphonic domain that audiences had not
        known before.”</p>

      <p>Those four notes are the DNA, not only of the opening movement, but, indeed, of the entire Symphony, appearing
        in various guises in each of its four movements. Stripped of its upbeats and ornaments, the lyrical first theme
        of the Andante con moto follows the same short-short-short-long pattern; if not immediately evident there, the
        regal second theme, set fortissimo in the oboes, trumpets, and horns, brings the rhythmic motif into clear
        focus. The third movement Scherzo presents an even purer distillation of the four-note motif, presenting it with
        a martial sternness.</p>

      <p>The passage from the Scherzo into the Finale represents one of Beethoven’s most breathtaking compositional
        accomplishments. The Scherzo’s forceful carriage diminishes to a pianississimo whisper, and a hushed tension
        builds as the strings sustain a dominant pedal; an overwhelming crescendo explodes in an incandescent C major at
        the arrival of Symphony’s concluding Allegro.</p>

      <p>Beethoven’s use of that four-note rhythmic motif to bind the Symphony’s four movements together contributes to
        the work’s sense of narrative unity (a quality which places the Fifth Symphony alongside the Sixth, the
        Pastoral, a musical journey of equally imaginative conception, and which was premiered on the same evening). The
        Fifth Symphony’s declamatory strength—that quintessentially Beethovenian quality of empowering the music to say
        something—signals the fulfillment of the “new path” to which Beethoven aspired at the dawn of the nineteenth
        century, and has installed this symphony as arguably the most iconic work in the classical repertoire. The
        nineteenth-century critic E.T.A. Hoffmann wrote, “How this magnificent composition carries the listener on and
        on in a continually ascending climax into the ghostly world of infinity! … [T]he human breast, squeezed by
        monstrous presentiments and destructive powers, seems to gasp for breath; soon a kindly figure approaches full
        of radiance, and illuminates the depths of terrifying night.”</p>
